Hey there, if you found your way here, you're most likely considering hiring me(please do!). This here is a collection of links to code I wrote, either in my university work or my personal projects. 

Regarding my uni projects, please note that this isn't nearly everything I've written(I picked out the interesting ones), I've gotten a lot better over the years, and more often than not deadlines forced me to hack together a quick solution without an opportunity to improve on it later. We were often graded on functionality first, lab report second, and code quality only third.

## Go

## Python

## C
